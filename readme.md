# Hi,

### It's resole79 here

I have had a dream since 8 years old: to become a **developer**.  
My first program was with the commodore 64 at 9 years old.  
After primary school, in Italy, I attended an IT school and that experience gave me the first skills and knowledge to become a web developer.  
I have been working as **web developer** for ten years.  
I came to the UK in 2014 and worked in hospitality.  
Now I'm studying Python at HyperionDev to return to my passion and work again as developer.
